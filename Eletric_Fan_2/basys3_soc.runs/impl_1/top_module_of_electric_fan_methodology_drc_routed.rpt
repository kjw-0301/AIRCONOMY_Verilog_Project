TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.359 ns between d11/dth11/count_usec_reg[11]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and d11/dth11/temperature_reg[1]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.359 ns between d11/dth11/count_usec_reg[11]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and d11/dth11/temperature_reg[2]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.359 ns between d11/dth11/count_usec_reg[11]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and d11/dth11/temperature_reg[3]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.359 ns between d11/dth11/count_usec_reg[11]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and d11/dth11/temperature_reg[4]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
